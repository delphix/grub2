IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPSTREAM BUGS

Like many other FSF projects, GRUB upstream has specific requisites for
accepting patches with regard to copyright assignment.  If you're going to
submit a patch, it is likely that it will only be accepted in upstream if you're
willing to submit your paperwork as well.

Because of this, we want to avoid diverging from upstream by adding patches to
the debian package unless we know the copyright issues can be sorted out.  We
encourage you to submit your work to upstream directly by sending a mail to the
GRUB maintainers <grub-devel@gnu.org>.
