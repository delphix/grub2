Description: The next generation of GNU GRUB [EXPERIMENTAL]
 GRUB2 (also known as PUPA) is the Preliminary Universal Programming
 Architecture for GRUB. It is a research project for the next generation of
 GNU GRUB. The most important goal is to make GNU GRUB cleaner, safer, more
 robust, more powerful, and more portable.
 .
 This package contains EXPERIMENTAL software which hasn't been properly tested
 and doesn't have all the expected features. For a stable and usable
 bootloader look at GRUB instead.
