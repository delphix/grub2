Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS version)
 GRUB 2 (also known as PUPA) is the Preliminary Universal Programming
 Architecture for GRUB. It is a research project for the next generation of
 GNU GRUB. The most important goal is to make GNU GRUB cleaner, safer, more
 robust, more powerful, and more portable.
 .
 GRUB 2 targets at the following goals:
 .
  - Scripting support, such as conditionals, loops, variables and functions.
  - Graphical interface.
  - Dynamic loading of modules in order to extend itself at the run time
    rather than at the build time.
  - Portability for various architectures.
  - Internationalization. This includes support for non-ASCII character code,
    message catalogs like gettext, fonts, graphics console, and so on.
  - Real memory management, to make GNU GRUB more extensible.
  - Modular, hierarchical, object-oriented framework for file systems, files,
    devices, drives, terminals, commands, partition tables and OS loaders.
  - Cross-platform installation which allows for installing GRUB from a
    different architecture.
  - Rescue mode saves unbootable cases. Stage 1.5 was eliminated.
  - Fix design mistakes in GRUB Legacy, which could not be solved for
    backward-compatibility, such as the way of numbering partitions. 
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.
