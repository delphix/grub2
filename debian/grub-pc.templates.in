_Description: Chainload from menu.lst?
 GRUB upgrade scripts have detected a GRUB Legacy setup in /boot/grub.
 .
 In order to replace the Legacy version of GRUB in your system, it is
 recommended that /boot/grub/menu.lst is adjusted to chainload GRUB 2
 from your existing GRUB Legacy setup.  This step may be automaticaly
 performed now.
 .
 It's recommended that you accept chainloading GRUB 2 from menu.lst, and
 verify that your new GRUB 2 setup is functional for you, before you install
 it directly to your MBR (Master Boot Record).
 .
 In either case, whenever you want GRUB 2 to be loaded directly from MBR,
 you can do so by issuing (as root) the following command:
 .
 upgrade-from-grub-legacy

Description: GRUB install devices:
 The grub-pc package is being upgraded.  This menu allows you to select which
 devices you'd like grub-install to be automatically run for, if any.
 .
 It is recommended that you do this in most situations, to prevent the installed
 GRUB from getting out of sync with other components such as grub.cfg or with
 newer Linux images it will have to load.
 .
 If you're unsure which drive is designated as boot drive by your BIOS, it is
 often a good idea to install GRUB to all of them.
 .
 Note: It is possible to install GRUB to partition boot records as well, and
 some appropriate partitions are offered here.  However, this forces GRUB to
 use the blocklist mechanism, which makes it less reliable, and therefore is
 not recommended.

Description: GRUB install devices:
 The GRUB boot loader was previously installed to a disk that is no longer
 present, or whose normally unique identifier has changed for some reason.
 It is important to make sure that the installed GRUB stays in sync with
 other components such as grub.cfg or with newer Linux images it will have
 to load, and so you should check again to make sure that GRUB is installed
 to the appropriate boot devices.

_Description: GRUB installation failed.  Continue?
 GRUB failed to install to the following devices:

 Do you want to continue anyway?  If you do, your computer may not start up
 properly.

Template: grub-pc/install_devices_empty
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Continue without installing GRUB?
 You chose not to install GRUB to any devices.  If you continue, the boot
 loader may not be properly configured, and when your computer next starts
 up it will use whatever was previously in the boot sector.  If there is an
 earlier version of GRUB 2 in the boot sector, it may be unable to load
 modules or handle the current configuration file.
 .
 If you are already running a different boot loader and want to carry on
 doing so, or if this is a special environment where you do not need a boot
 loader, then you should continue anyway.  Otherwise, you should install
 GRUB somewhere.
