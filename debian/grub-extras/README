grub-extras is meant to be used as an overlay on grub2 source tree.

Build instructions:

  - Copy grub-extras in a subdirectory of your grub2 checkout.
    For example, "grub-extras".

  - Adjust autogen.sh to process grub-extras/conf/*.rmk files.

  - Adjust Makefile.in to include the grub-extras/conf/*.mk file
    corresponding to your architecture.
    Also export GRUB_EXTRAS variable, it should point to the top
    level of your grub-extras directory.

  - Export enable_* variables for the components you want
    (e.g. enable_zfs=yes).

  - Build GRUB as usual.
