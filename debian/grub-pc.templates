_Description: Chainload from menu.lst?
 GRUB upgrade scripts have detected a GRUB Legacy setup in /boot/grub.
 .
 In order to replace the Legacy version of GRUB in your system, it is
 recommended that /boot/grub/menu.lst is adjusted to chainload GRUB 2
 from your existing GRUB Legacy setup.  This step may be automaticaly
 performed now.
 .
 It's recommended that you accept chainloading GRUB 2 from menu.lst, and
 verify that your new GRUB 2 setup is functional for you, before you install
 it directly to your MBR (Master Boot Record).
 .
 In either case, whenever you want GRUB 2 to be loaded directly from MBR,
 you can do so by issuing (as root) the following command:
 .

Description: GRUB install devices:
 The grub-pc package is being upgraded.  This menu allows you to select which
 devices you'd like grub-install to be automatically run for, if any.
 .
 It is recommended that you do this in most situations, to prevent the installed
 GRUB from getting out of sync with other components such as grub.cfg or with
 newer Linux images it will have to load.
 .
 If you're unsure which drive is designated as boot drive by your BIOS, it is
 often a good idea to install GRUB to all of them.
